# Catch A Flight

# Catch a Flight

My personal take on:
_**Event Storming, Domain-Driven Design, Hexagonal Architecture, Modularity, Microservices, Cloud Design Patterns, 
Data-Oriented Programming, Event-Driven, Design, SQL and NoSQL Databases, REST, GraphQL, gRPC, Server-Side Events, 
WebSockets, Async Messaging, with JDK 24 and Spring Boot 3**_. And much more ...

The main goal of this project is to find, test and describe in details the best possible practices for software 
engineering in Java and Spring Boot ecosystem.
